In machine learning terms, $p_u$ and $q_i$ are called the *embeddings* of the user $u$ and of the movie $i$ respectively.

Keras however, uses a *declarative* (also called *symbolic*) programming style, meaning that when you write `Dot()([x, y])`, you tell Keras than when you will call the *fit* function of your model in the future, you will want to do a dot product between the future values that *x* and *y* will have.

Since mini-batching means considering multiple training samples at the same time, Keras keeps the first dimension of each layer to stack the samples of each batch, this is why `None` is written, the actual batch_size being set at training time when calling the `fit` function. This is also why we had to set `axes=1` when calling the `Dot` layer in the `get_mf_model` function, because the first dimension (axe 0) of each layer is kept for the batches. And about the `optimizer='adam'`, it is just a variation of mini-batch SGD that is faster, we'll get into more details about SGD variations in the optional parts of this notebook."

    "F1 is now much better than with the dummy classifier, however is is still not very convincing. This is quite normal given the size of the dataset we are using, which is pretty small to get really meaningful embeddings. But with bigger datasets, reusing embeddings as features for auxiliary tasks such as classification is actually a very effective way of doing so when there is no other informations about the items we try to classify. Here the items are the movies, the dataset doesn't provide more information about them, but one could imagine fetching from internet textual descriptions of the movies and use them as features alongside the embeddings to improve the classification results."
